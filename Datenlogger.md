The SparkFun OpenLog is an open source data logger.
Simple to use, simple to change.
We wanted to create a serial logger that just worked.
Power up this device and it will start logging any received serial data
at 9600bps.
Sending Ctrl+z three times will drop out of logging and in to command
mode.
‘new' will create a new file.
‘md' makes a directory.
‘?' brings up the list of commands.
OpenLog doesn't do a lot, but it does log serial streams extremely well.
